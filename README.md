## Roadmap (W.I.P)

Not all. Only included last update.

✅It is now possible to dismiss multiple Trails.

✅If the file to be introduced cannot be found, it will now be presented to you.

✅The screen no longer flashes back and forth while the process to introduce is running.

✅When saving, it now checks and suggests if there are any rejection omissions.

✅When saving, it now indicates which folder and file it is accessing.

✅The description provided when input is required is now somewhat easier to read.

✅We have rewritten some of the code and believe it is now faster and more stable to work with.
